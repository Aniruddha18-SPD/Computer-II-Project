Discord Bot using Python

Hello! Welcome to my Computer Science II Final project! 

I have made a Discord Bot named Jeffery. This bot was influenced by Geoffrey Butler (from Fresh Prince) and J.A.R.V.I.S ( Iron man's AI assistant). This bot  handles various 
functionalities such as showing memes, recommending various movies classified by genres, returning the updated market value of Bitcoin in dollars, returning jokes and giving 
inspiration quotes. All of the returned values are real-time outputs from websites such as IMBD.

Please refer to  [instructions.txt](https://github.com/Aniruddha18-SPD/Computer-II-Project/blob/main/instructions.txt) for keywords to use the bot.

The code needs your Discord Bot Token to run successfully. Inorder to get your token, please follow [this guide.](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) 

Get your token and put it at the end of the [main.py](https://github.com/Aniruddha18-SPD/Computer-II-Project/blob/main/main.py)
