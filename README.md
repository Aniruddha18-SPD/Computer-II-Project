Discord Bot using Python

Hello! Welcome to my Computer Science II Final project! 

I have made a Discord Bot named Jeffery. This bot has been influenced by Geoffrey Butler (from Fresh Prince) and J.A.R.V.I.S ( Iron man's AI assistant). This bot  handles various 
functionalities such as showing memes, recommending various movies classified by genres, returning the updated market value of Bitcoin in dollars, returning jokes and giving 
inspiration quotes.
